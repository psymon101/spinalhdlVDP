# TASKS.md

**Updated:** 2026-05-22 (RGB565 directcolor and CLS Optimization lanes closed; bench-framing investigation open; baseline locked at `9e3c252`.)
**Purpose:** Authoritative active task ledger for `spinalhdlVDP`. Optimized for fast operational reading. Deep historical detail is in `TASKS_HISTORY.md`.

Status values: `TODO`, `IN-PROGRESS`, `DEFERRED`, `DONE`

## How to Use This File

- Active state lives in **Live Lane State** and **Next Up / Open Queue**.
- Closed-lane history, extended proof narratives, and phase-by-phase task detail are in `TASKS_HISTORY.md`.
- Do not begin a task if any entry in its `depends_on` list is not `DONE`.
- A task is only `DONE` when its `validation` criteria are met on hardware (or simulation, for tasks not yet at hardware stage).

## Live Lane State

This section tracks the active lane.

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Task** | **CLS Optimization — gate2 readAsync→readSync BSRAM conversion** |
| **Status** | **DONE** |
| **Latest Commit** | `a9f4735` (CP-B: copper hdmaDataArray readSync, BrightForge #10449) |
| **Latest Auth Mail** | BrightForge #10497 (PnR delta reported) |
| **Summary** | Staged CLS relief lane. CP-A (`bab5c5f`): blitter srcRam 512×16 readAsync→readSync BSRAM. CP-B (`a9f4735`): copper hdmaDataArray 256×16 readAsync→readSync BSRAM. Both merged into `main` at `eedf617`. CP-B yielded null PnR payoff (`hdmaDataArray` stayed distributed). Actual CLS relief came from R5.4 copper `prog`-to-BSRAM shift (down 4 pts). No CP-C scoped. Lane complete. |
| **Next Step** | Closeout. |

## Next Up / Open Queue

### RGB565 Hardware Bench Framing Investigation
- **Status:** **OPEN** (#10503 follow-up). RTL feature proven; hardware-bench setup does not reliably exercise it.
- **Scope:** Identify why the ESP8266 → FPGA bench path shows 1bpp-test-pattern output despite clean firmware trace (#10501) and symmetric RTL (#10500/#10502). Suspects: QspiSlave byte-level pipeline, TopTang20kHdmiScenario45HostVerilog wiring divergence, or signal-integrity/CDC hardware-only issue.
- **Next Step:** BrightForge to extend harness to full QSPI byte-stream integration sim (option 1) and re-walk `TopTang20kHdmi` wiring (option 3). Blocked until `BitmapCtrlCommitSim.scala` landed.

### Atari ST Adapter Lane
- **Status:** **PAUSED** (#9783). Checkpoint A accepted (#9782).
- **Scope:** 320×200 4-plane planar only. No sprites/blitter for v1.

## Agent Rules for This File

| Rule | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| Dependency gate | Do not begin if any `depends_on` is not `DONE` |
| Scope boundary | Do not implement anything in `scope_boundary` as excluded |
| DONE definition | `DONE` only when `validation` criteria met on hardware (or sim) |
| Status sync | Update status field when marking `IN-PROGRESS` or `DONE` |
| Scope immutability | Do not modify `depends_on` or `scope_boundary` without instruction |

### Deduplication Rule
Before opening a new lane, landing code, or sending a proof packet, verify the task ID does not already appear in `TASKS.md` Live Lane State or project mail from the last 48 hours. If already in flight, halt and request a BronzeGate ruling.

### Audit HOLD Iteration Limit
If CyanPeak issues `HOLD`, BrightForge may correct and resubmit once. A second `HOLD` on the same scope must escalate to BronzeGate. No third HOLD cycle without PM intervention.

---

## Lane-Closeout Team Check (Mandatory)

At every large-task closeout, `TopazCliff` must send a PM team check to all active agents before opening the next large lane.

Purpose: surface blockers, process friction, and capacity constraints while they are fresh, rather than letting them accumulate across lanes.

Required reply content from each agent:
1. **Blockers** — tooling, docs, coordination, handoffs, stale dependencies, unclear scope
2. **Process friction** — mail patterns, lane handoffs, proof requirements, review cycles
3. **Suggestions** — start/stop/change at large-task boundaries
4. **Status** — current lane/focus and capacity for next PM-assigned task

No new large lane may be opened until the team check has been sent and replies have been reviewed. Small side lanes (doc fixes, sketch tweaks, sim-only cleanup) are exempt.

## Lane-Open Packet Template

Every new implementation lane must open with one authoritative packet. Copy this template into the kick-off mail or doc update.

For full pre-execution planning (primitive boundary, interfaces, data model, timing, risks, exit condition), use `TASK_TEMPLATE.md`.
